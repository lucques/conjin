# anchors

This module allows you to set up a semantic anchor tree in a linear fashion. It is used e.g. by the `nav-build` module to set up the navigation titles.

So let's say you have the following document structure:

```
Top level title
1. First section
2. Second section
2.1. Subsection
```

Then you can create anchor id's for each of these sections like this:

```
top-level
- first-section
- second-section
  - subsection
```

The anchor for the last subsection will then be `top-level-second-section-subsection`. The anchor tree will be generated by calls to `anchor_create(level, id)` where a level and an id is passed. In the example, the level of "1. First Section" is 2 and the id is `first-section`.
