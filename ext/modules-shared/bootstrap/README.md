# Usage

In either case, a JS file is added to the page.

The bootstrap framework can be used in one of two ways.
1. As a standalone CSS file, 
2. As partials imported to a custom CSS file.

Activate 2. by setting the `import_standalone_css` config flag to `false`. This will make sure the standalone CSS file is not loaded.
