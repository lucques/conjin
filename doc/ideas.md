# Ideas for future
- When it comes to anchors, there is currently only a processing component to them.
    - We could add a preprocessing compontent:
        - Preprocessing to build the nav
        - Processing to print the actual title
        - Idea: Integrate this by handling the "add-anchor-command" twice, but differently
